Class Format
=======================

This class is being taught differently than in past years.

* Students will be required to watch 3 hours of lectures a week that will be
  available on the web (videos recorded in Spring, 2013). These follow the
  slides and lecture notes from last year, but some new material will also be
  developed.  Enrolled students can find the videos on the 
  `Canvas Lecture Videos <https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/893991/wiki/lecture-videos>`_ page.
  
* There will be a short quiz associated with each lecture.  
  
* For on-campus students, the class meets for a lab session
  T-Th, 2:30 - 3:20 in OUG 136. This
  is an Active Learning Classroom and class time will be used primarily for
  working together with other students on exercises designed to illustrate and
  reinforce the material. Some additional new material will also be presented.
  Attendance will be required at these sessions, and each lab will contain
  some work that is turned in for grading.
  
* Undergraduates should enroll in AMath 483 and graduate students in 583. The
  lectures and classroom sessions are identical, but the 583 course will have
  some additional and/or more advanced assignments. The class sizes are capped
  due to the size of the room and additional students cannot be accomodated.
  
* Section 583-B is for online Masters degree students only and is not
  available to on-campus students. Students in this section will view the same
  video lectures as on-campus students. In addition, parts of the T-Th
  lab sessions will be taped and available to watch, along with the
  exercises tackled by students in these sessions.
  
* Homework and a final project will consist primarily of programming
  assignments.
