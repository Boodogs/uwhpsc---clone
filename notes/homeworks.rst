Homework 
====================

There will be 6 homeworks during the quarter with
tentative due dates listed below:

 * :ref:`homework1`: 4/10
 * Homework 2: 4/17
 * Homework 3: 5/1 
 * Homework 4: 5/8
 * Homework 5: 5/22
 * Homework 6: 5/29

There will be a "final project" due on Thursday June 6.  This will
count twice as much as a homework (20 points) and will be similar in
spirit but longer and tying together several things from the quarter
into a more interesting computing assignment.
